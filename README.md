# Employee Management System (Java)

## 📌 Project Description
This is a **simple Employee Management System built using Java**.  
The project demonstrates basic **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts by managing two types of employees:

- **Full-Time Employees**
- **Part-Time Employees**

The system calculates and prints the **salary** of employees based on their employment type.

---

## 🎯 Features
- Add Full-Time employees with fixed monthly salary
- Add Part-Time employees with hourly wage
- Calculate salary for both employee types
- Display employee details and salary
- Console-based (menu-driven / simple output)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java (Core Java)
- OOP Concepts:
  - Inheritance
  - Method Overriding
  - Polymorphism
  - Encapsulation

---

## 🧩 Project Structure
- `Employee` is the **base class**
- `FullTimeEmployee` and `PartTimeEmployee` extend `Employee`
- Each employee type has its own salary calculation method
- The program prints employee details along with calculated salary

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Clear understanding of Java OOP concepts
- Practical use of inheritance and polymorphism
- Basic salary calculation logic
